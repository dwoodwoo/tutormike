**"Tutor Mike helped me to go from a 3 to a 5 on my AP Physics exam. Working with him, I mastered the knowledge and gained the self-confidence I needed to achieve this top score. I'll be going back to him for my AP Calculus and AP Chemistry classes.**

**"Tutor Mike helped me study for my college Calculus class. That subject was really hard for me, and I was able to focus better and get more of my homework done when we worked together on it. After doing the homework and understanding the material better, I got a higher score on the final exam."**
