## Tutoring Services
Tutor Mike can help you to reach extreme proficiency in most science and math-related subject areas. Contact me to find out more and set up a free consultation.

### **Academic Tutoring**:
Improve your grades in particular courses. Gain greater understanding and better subject retention, which will serve you both in your current courses, as well as in the more advanced courses you'll be taking in the future.

### Math Tutoring
* Algebra I & II 
* Intermediate Algebra
* Geometry
* Trignometry
* Pre-Calculus
* Calculus
* Linear Algebra
* Statistics

### Science Tutoring
* Physics
* Chemistry
* Computer Science and Programming
* Biology
* Integrated Science

I work with individuals to help them master these subjects at all levels. When I was in high school, I mastered the technique of learning content material cold, through a vital balancing of a deeper understanding of the logic connecting many disparate topics against the practice of knowing the formulas and approaches to apply in any given test problem situation. 

### **Advanced Placement (AP) Subjects**:
I cover the following AP subjects, many of which I completed myself in high school and received top scores on the AP Exams, granting me an offer of sophomore standing upon my entry into college at Harvard.

### AP Science Subjects
* Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism
* Physics C: Mechanics
* Physics 1 (Note this is new in 2014-15 and replaces AP Physics B)
* Physics 2 (Note this is new in 2014-15 and replaces AP Physics B)
* Chemistry
* Biology
* Computer Science A
* Environmental Science

### AP Math Subjects
* Calculus BC
* Calculus AB
* Statistics

This tutoring is a cross between academic tutoring and test preparation, for high school students and nontraditional learners who are taking AP classes and/or preparing to take the AP Exams to earn college credit for this work. It will improve both course performance and the test score. I also believe that AP courses and testing can be a great way for students to begin planning their college careers, and this is an important aspect of the opportunity that is often overlooked in the push to handle all of the content. The AP program gives both traditional and nontraditional students a way to get a leg up on college.

### Standardized Test Preparation
I can help you with all your essential test preparation needs.

* SAT / ACT
* SAT Subjects:
  * Math Level 1
  * Math Level 2
  * Physics
  * Chemistry
  * Biology E/M
  * U.S. History
  * World History
  * Literature
* SSAT
* ISEE
* CBEST

I have officially scored in the top 1% on all of the above tests I've taken for credit, and I keep up with ongoing revisions. If I haven't formally taken a test for credit, I've reviewed the material extensively and practiced the test to reach an equivalent level.

Scoring well on these tests means knowing both the material on the exams and and the test-taking strategies that will help you to get the most right answers in the allotted time. We cover all the material that appears on the exam, going over many sample test problems and strategies, so that students are practiced and prepared to do their best on testing day. 

### Specialty Tutoring and Coaching
In addition to academic coaching and test preparation, I have helped many students of all ages in the following areas.

 * Basic Study and Learning Skills
 * Organization and Time Management
 * Confidence-Building and Overcoming Anxiety
 * Engineering and Technology Topics
 * College and Career Planning
 * Nontraditional College Alternatives
 * Home-Schooling

I firmly believe that the educational process, even at the highest of levels, does an inadequate job of preparing students to pursue an authentic, mission-driven professional life, and my coaching draws from all the best practices of the positive psychology movement to deliver amazingly effective results. I also build upon over a decade of experience in the engineering and technology arena, where I worked as a top technical trainer, to deliver custom learning programs by special request.
