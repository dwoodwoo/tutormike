## About Mike

I've been passionate about tutoring since I was in high school myself, assisting my fellow students as a member of the California Scholarship Federation. I custom tailor my tutoring to each student, and I work best with individuals who are reflective and fundamentally enjoy learning. My greatest strength as a tutor is in making difficult, technical, and complex subjects more digestible to the absolute beginner, building consistently on the basics in a way that fosters both subject mastery and deeper understanding.

In my own schooling, I discovered a natural talent for science and math, which I nourished to achieve scores in the top 1% on many standardized tests. Over the years, I've helped many others boost their SAT and AP scores significantly.

I also know from personal experience what it takes to place into top league schools. Achievement at the high school level determines success in college and throughout life. But that alone is not enough.

#### How I'm Different

Even the best of colleges can fall short in preparing students for the shift from book learning to a successful life, and even as I push for ultimate subject mastery, I am also mindful about helping to build the self-awareness skills that will prove necessary to navigate this transition. This is what separates my approach from all the rest, and I've found these two prongs to be mutually reinforcing.

I have over a decade of experience as a tutor, teacher and technical trainer, augmented with a multi-faceted early career in computer graphics technology and a fair variety of professional explorations. I've encountered many of the land mines that can thwart a promising college career and transition into a satisfying, mission-driven adult life, and I've seen just how important such awareness can be to academic success, both in the short-run and the long-run.

#### Advanced Placement
My approach to tutoring for AP Subjects draws upon my deep inspiration from and retention of this material. I help my students to connect the naive joy and beauty they may find in the subject with the nitty-gritty details and developments that can be offputting and overwhelming. I've often found that a small misconception or confusion about one particular detail can expand into an entire realm of confusion or apprehension, and I know how to probe, isolate, and reconstruct a more effective understanding, while building confidence and releasing fear. Of course, doing well on these exams also requires plenty of discipline and motivation. I provide a structure to the preparation that eliminates roadblocks and keeps the momentum going.

#### Academic Coaching
Through my coaching, I can help you gain general learning skills, to help you with effective studying, work organization, and time management. My coaching includes getting the most from available academic resources, college application choices, and pre-career advising.

### Effective Tutoring
Above all, I have a long history of helping students to overcome academic blocks. The power to do well acadmically can be TRAINED. Directed training has proven to be the key to all students placing higher. When students are internally motivated to achieve, industry performace data has shown that those who receive tutoring average 250 points better on the SAT than those who don't.

I take on all motivated students -- however, those who receive the greatest benefit from my services have some prior practice, with certain focused areas of struggle. That way, our time can be directed toward making the biggest difference in grades, test results, and student satisfaction. I can help beginners find their way through a mountain of material, and I can help students who are behind and struggling to regain their bearings, but the process in these situations will take more time and commitment on the student's part.
