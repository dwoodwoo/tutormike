# About Mike

I've been passionate about tutoring since I was in high school myself, assisting my fellow students as a member of the California Scholarship Federation. I custom tailor my tutoring to each student, and I work best with individuals who are reflective and fundamentally enjoy learning. My greatest strength as a tutor is in making difficult, advanced, and complex subjects more digestible to the absolute beginner, building consistently on the basics in a way that fosters both subject mastery and deeper understanding.

In my own schooling, I discovered a natural talent for science and math, which I nourished to achieve scores in the top 1% on many standardized tests. Over the years, I've helped many others boost their SAT scores significantly.

I also know from personal experience what it takes to place into top league schools. Achievement at the high school level determines success in college and throughout life. But that alone is not enough.

#### How I'm Different

Even the best of colleges can fall short in preparing students for the shift from book learning to a successful life, and while I push for the ultimate in subject mastery, I am also dedicated to imparting the self-awareness skills that will prove necessary to navigate this transition. This is what separates my approach from all the rest, and I've found these two prongs to be mutually reinforcing.

I have over a decade of experience as a tutor, teacher and technical trainer, augmented with a multi-faceted early career in computer graphics technolgy and a fair variety of professional explorations. I've received a U.S. Patent on a 3-D scanning technology that I invented. I've encountered many of the land mines that can thwart a promising college career and transition into a satisfying, mission-driven adult life, and I've seen just how important such mindfulness can be to academic success, both in the short-run and the long-run.

#### Advanced Placement

#### Academic Coaching
Through my coaching, I can help you gain general learning skills, to help you with effective studying, work organization, and time management. My coaching is unique to the industry, as it incorporates confidence-building, getting the most from available academic resources, college application choices, and pre-career advising. One of the benefits of working with me is that I provide a wide array of services that I custom tailor to each individual, in response to thier specific strengths and needs.

### Effective Tutoring
Above all, 
The power to do well acadmically can be TRAINED. Directed training has proven to be the key to all students placing higher. (some study) shows that students who receive tutoring average (178) points better on the SAT than those who don't. Students with me will receive a combination of subject material knowledge and test-taking strategy.

I take on all students -- however, those who receive the greatest benefit from my services have some prior practice, with certain focused areas of struggle. That way, our time can be focused toward making the biggest difference in grades, test results, and student satisfaction.
