## Academic Tutoring
I can help you to improve your grades in particular courses, to gain greater understanding and better subject retention. When it comes to science, math, or enginnering-related courses, I'm your go-to tutor. I learned this material cold the first time though, and I've had many occasions throughout my career to apply and expand upon it.

### Advanced Placement
One of my specialties is working with high school students who are preparing to take the AP Exams. I cover most of the science and math AP subjects, along with a few others. I prepared for and completed many of these exams myself, receiving top scores that granted me an offer of sophomore standing upon my entry into college at Harvard.

This tutoring is a cross between academic tutoring and test preparation. Most students take an academic program in school to prepare for the exams, and my tutoring is aimed at both improving the course performance and doing better on the test. I also believe that AP courses and testing can be a great way for both traditional and nontraditional students to get a leg up on college.

## Test Preparation
I can help you to gain the knowledge, the confidence, and the operating strategies to boost your scores on standardized tests. 
Scoring well on these tests means knowing both the contained material and and the test-taking strategies that will help you to get the most right answers in the allotted time. I cover all the material that appears on the exam, going over many sample test problems and strategies, so that my students are practiced and prepared to do their best on testing day.
I have officially scored in the top 1% on many of these tests when I took them, and I keep current with all the revisions and changes. For tests I haven't formally taken, I've reviewed the material extensively and reached a consistent, comparable level on practice tests.

## Academic Coaching
I can help you gain general learning skills, to help you with effective studying, work organization, and time management. I also provide academic coaching, which includes confidence building, getting the most from available academic resources, college applications, and pre-career advising. One of the benefits of working with me is that I provide a wide array of services that I custom tailor to each individual, building upon specific strengths and needs.
