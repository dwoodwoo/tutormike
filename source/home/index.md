## Academic Tutoring
I can help you to improve your grades in particular courses, to gain greater understanding and better subject retention. When it comes to science, math, or enginnering-related courses, I'm your go-to tutor. I learned this material cold the first time though, and I have had many occasions throughout my career to apply and expand upon it.

## Test Preparation
I can help you to gain the knowledge, the confidence, and the operating strategies to boost your scores on standardized tests. Scoring well on these tests means knowing both the material on these exams and and the test strategies that will help you to get the most right answers in the allotted time. We cover all the material that appears on the exam, going over many sample test problems and strategies, so that students are practiced and prepared to do their best on testing day.
I have officially scored in the top 1% on many of these tests when I took them, and I keep current with all the revisions and changes. For tests I haven't formally taken, I've reviewed the material extensively and reached a consistent comparable level on practice material.
