I work best with individuals who are reflective and enjoy learning, custom tailoring my tutoring to their needs. My strength is making difficult, technical, and complex subjects digestible to a beginner. I want to make sure my students master the basics so that they gain a deeper understanding of the subject.\n\nThose who receive the greatest benefit from my services have some prior practice, with certain focused areas of struggle. I can help beginners find their way through a mountain of material, and I can help students who are behind and struggling to regain their bearings. The process in these situations will take time and commitment on the student’s part. \n\n### How I’m Different\nMy natural talent for science and math allowed me to score in the top 1% on many standardized tests. Over the years, I’ve helped many others boost their SAT and AP scores significantly. I know from personal experience what it takes to place into top league schools. Achievement at the high school level determines success in college and throughout life. But that alone is not enough.\n\nEven the best of colleges can fall short in preparing students for the shift from book learning to a successful adult life. Even as I push for subject mastery, I am mindful about the need to build the self-awareness that is necessary to navigate the transition from school to working life. Emphasizing the need for emotional as well as intellectual understanding makes my approach unique, since both are mutually reinforcing.\n\nDuring my career I’ve encountered many of the land mines that can thwart a promising college career and transition into a satisfying, mission-driven life. My work as a tutor, teacher and technical trainer, augmented with a multi-faceted career in computer graphics technology and other professional explorations taught me how important self-awareness can be to academic success, both in the short and long run.\n\n### Advanced Placement\nMy approach to tutoring for Advanced Placement Subjects draws upon my inspiration from and retention of this material. I help my students to connect the naive joy and beauty they may find in the subject with the nitty-gritty details that can be off-putting and even overwhelming. I’ve often found that a small misconception or confusion about one particular detail can expand into bewildering confusion and apprehension about math or science. I know how to probe, isolate, and reconstruct a more effective understanding, while building confidence and releasing the fears that interfere with the joy of learning. Of course, doing well on these exams also requires motivation and discipline. I provide a structure that eliminates mental roadblocks and keeps the momentum going.\n\n### Academic Coaching\nThrough my coaching, I help students gain general learning skills: studying, work and time management. My coaching includes getting the most from available academic resources, college application choices, and pre-career advising.\n\n## Effective Tutoring\nThe power to do well academically can be TRAINED. Directed training has proven to be the key to all students placing higher. Industry performance data has shown that those who receive tutoring average 250 points better on the SAT than those who don’t get help.\n\nContact me for a free consultation.\n","source":"home/index.md","raw":"title: home\ndate: 2015-12-04 16:50:37\n---\n\n## Welcome to Tutor Mike's\n\n<img src=\"https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_200_200/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAIRAAAAJDA0NmVmY2NmLTQ0YjktNGI0Ni1iNzY2LWE5N2NlMGQ5MTk5MQ.jpg\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;radius: 10px;\">\n\n\nI’ve been passionate about tutoring since I assisted my fellow students in high school as a member of the California Scholarship Federation.
