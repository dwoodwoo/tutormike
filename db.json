I custom tailor my tutoring to each student, and I work best with individuals who are reflective and fundamentally enjoy learning. My specialty is in making difficult, advanced, and complex subjects more digestible to the absolute beginner, building consistently on the basics in a way that fosters both subject mastery and deeper understanding.\n\nIn my own schooling, I discovered a natural talent for science and math, which I nourished to achieve scores in the top 1% on many standardized tests. Over the years, I've helped many others boost their SAT scores significantly.\n\nI know from personal experience what it takes to place into top league schools. Achievement at the high school level determines success in college and throughout life.\n\nI also have over a decade of experience as a teacher and tutor, augmented with a multi-faceted early career in computer graphics technolgy, and a variety of professional explorations.\n\nThe power to do well acadmically can be TRAINED. Directed training has proven to be the key to all students placing higher. (some study) shows that students who receive tutoring average (178) points better on the SAT than those who don't. Students with me will receive a combination of subject material knowledge and test-taking strategy.\n\nI take on all students -- however, those who receive the greatest benefit from my services have some prior practice, with certain focused areas of struggle.

I custom tailor my tutoring to each student, and I work best with individuals who are reflective and fundamentally enjoy learning. My specialty is in making difficult, advanced, and complex subjects more digestible to the absolute beginner, building consistently on the basics in a way that fosters both subject mastery and deeper understanding.\n\nIn my own schooling, I discovered a natural talent for science and math, which I nourished to achieve scores in the top 1% on many standardized tests. Over the years, I've helped many others boost their SAT scores significantly.\n\nI know from personal experience what it takes to place into top league schools. Achievement at the high school level determines success in college and throughout life.\n\nI also have over a decade of experience as a teacher and tutor, augmented with a multi-faceted early career in computer graphics technolgy, and a variety of professional explorations.\n\nThe power to do well acadmically can be TRAINED.
